However, the sight of Aegon and his dragon persuaded Ronnel to bend the knee, ensuring the Vale's submission without bloodshed.

The Valyrians didn't use coats of arms, so to enter the politics of Westeros, the Targaryens adopted a three-headed dragon as their sigil. 114 years later, Aegon and his sister-wives, Visenya and Rhaenys, turn their gaze westward. With their dragons—Balerion, Meraxes, and Vhagar—the Three-Headed Dragon is poised to unite all seven kingdoms of Westeros under one banner. This opportunity, will you capture it? Or let it slip?"
