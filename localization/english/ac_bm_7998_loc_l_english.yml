Arrogant and defiant, Harren believed his mighty castle to be impregnable, but his hubris was his downfall. Aegon Targaryen and his dragon Balerion the Black Dread turned Harrenhal into a smoldering ruin, ending the line of House Hoare in dragonfire."

 bookmark_ac_ronnel_arryn_desc:0 "Ronnel Arryn, the young King of the Vale, inherited the Eyrie at a tender age. His rule was gentle, and he was deeply loved by his people, though many saw him as weak. When Aegon Targaryen arrived in the Vale, Ronnel's mother, Sharra Arryn, sought to defend their kingdom. However, the sight of Aegon and his dragon persuaded Ronnel to bend the knee, ensuring the Vale's submission without bloodshed. He famously asked to ride on the dragon's back, a request Aegon granted, solidifying his place as a loyal vassal."

Yet, upon witnessing the devastation of the Field of Fire and the might of the dragons, Torrhen chose to kneel rather than risk the annihilation of his people. Known henceforth as the King Who Knelt, his submission ensured the North's preservation and its place within the new order, where Stark honor and loyalty would be respected."

The Valyrians didn't use coats of arms, so to enter the politics of Westeros, the Targaryens adopted a three-headed dragon as their sigil. 114 years later, Aegon and his sister-wives, Visenya and Rhaenys, turn their gaze westward. With their dragons—Balerion, Meraxes, and Vhagar—the Three-Headed Dragon is poised to unite all seven kingdoms of Westeros under one banner. This opportunity, will you capture it? Or let it slip?"
