 bookmark_ac_aegon_targaryen_desc:0 "Aegon I Targaryen, known as Aegon the Conqueror, is the founder of the Targaryen dynasty and the first King of the Seven Kingdoms. With his sisters, Visenya and Rhaenys, and their dragons, Aegon set out to unite Westeros under a single rule. His ambition and strength led to the forging of the Iron Throne, a symbol of his dominion. His conquest is marked by both his martial prowess and his keen political insight, establishing a legacy that would echo through the ages."

 bookmark_ac_visenya_targaryen_desc:0 "Visenya Targaryen, elder sister to Aegon the Conqueror, is as fierce as she is loyal. A warrior of unmatched skill, she wielded the Valyrian steel sword Dark Sister and rode the dragon Vhagar. Known for her stern demeanor and fierce temper, Visenya played a crucial role in her brother's conquest, securing the loyalty of the conquered through fear and fire. Her influence extended beyond the battlefield, shaping the early Targaryen reign with her wisdom and ruthlessness."

 bookmark_ac_rhaenys_targaryen_desc:0 "Rhaenys Targaryen, the younger sister of Aegon the Conqueror, is known for her beauty, charm, and the love she inspired in those around her. She rode the dragon Meraxes, whose might was crucial in subduing many of the kingdoms during Aegon's Conquest. Unlike her sister Visenya, Rhaenys preferred diplomacy and was beloved by the people. Yet, she was no less formidable, meeting her end in battle at Hellholt, where she perished in a fiery blaze, leaving behind a legacy of grace and strength."

 bookmark_ac_harren_hoare_desc:0 "Harren Hoare, better known as Harren the Black, was the last King of the Isles and the Rivers. His rule was marked by cruelty and the construction of the massive fortress Harrenhal, built with the blood and toil of his people. Arrogant and defiant, Harren believed his mighty castle to be impregnable, but his hubris was his downfall. Aegon Targaryen and his dragon Balerion the Black Dread turned Harrenhal into a smoldering ruin, ending the line of House Hoare in dragonfire."

 bookmark_ac_ronnel_arryn_desc:0 "Ronnel Arryn, the young King of the Vale, inherited the Eyrie at a tender age. His rule was gentle, and he was deeply loved by his people, though many saw him as weak. When Aegon Targaryen arrived in the Vale, Ronnel's mother, Sharra Arryn, sought to defend their kingdom. However, the sight of Aegon and his dragon persuaded Ronnel to bend the knee, ensuring the Vale's submission without bloodshed. He famously asked to ride on the dragon's back, a request Aegon granted, solidifying his place as a loyal vassal."

 bookmark_ac_loren_lannister_desc:0 "Loren I Lannister, King of the Rock, was a proud and valiant ruler. Together with King Mern Gardener of the Reach, he opposed Aegon Targaryen's conquest, leading a vast host against the Targaryen forces. However, Loren witnessed the devastation wrought by the dragons at the Field of Fire, where his army was consumed by flames. Surviving the inferno, Loren wisely bent the knee to Aegon, securing the Lannisters' continued dominance in the West as Lords of Casterly Rock."

 bookmark_ac_mern_gardener_desc:0 "Mern IX Gardener, the last King of the Reach, ruled a land of plenty and prosperity. He led his forces alongside Loren Lannister in a grand alliance to resist Aegon the Conqueror. Yet, his pride and valor were no match for the dragons. At the Field of Fire, Mern and his sons were incinerated, leaving House Gardener extinct. His death marked the end of an ancient dynasty, and the fertile lands of the Reach fell into the hands of House Tyrell, who wisely bent the knee to Aegon."
 
 bookmark_ac_meria_martell:0 "Meria Martell"
 bookmark_ac_meria_martell_desc:0 "Meria Martell, the Princess of Dorne, was a ruler of indomitable will and great cunning. Despite her age and the might of Aegon Targaryen's forces, she refused to submit to the Targaryen conquest. Known as the Yellow Toad of Dorne for her tenacity, Meria employed guerrilla tactics, harrying the Targaryens with relentless desert warfare. Dorne remained unconquered in her lifetime, a testament to her resilience and strategic acumen, and her legacy continued to inspire her descendants."

 bookmark_ac_torrhen_stark_desc:0 "Torrhen Stark, the King in the North, was a wise and pragmatic leader. As Aegon Targaryen's conquest swept across Westeros, Torrhen marched his forces south to confront the invader. Yet, upon witnessing the devastation of the Field of Fire and the might of the dragons, Torrhen chose to kneel rather than risk the annihilation of his people. Known henceforth as the King Who Knelt, his submission ensured the North's preservation and its place within the new order, where Stark honor and loyalty would be respected."

 bookmark_ac_argilac_durrandon_desc:0 "Argilac Durrandon, known as Argilac the Arrogant, was the last Storm King of House Durrandon. Proud and defiant, Argilac refused Aegon Targaryen's offer of alliance and instead chose to face him in battle. He fought valiantly at the Last Storm, where he met his end in single combat against Orys Baratheon, Aegon's general and rumored half-brother. With Argilac's death, House Durrandon was extinguished, and the Stormlands passed to House Baratheon, marking the end of an era for the Stormlands."

The Valyrians didn't use coats of arms, so to enter the politics of Westeros, the Targaryens adopted a three-headed dragon as their sigil. 114 years later, Aegon and his sister-wives, Visenya and Rhaenys, turn their gaze westward. With their dragons—Balerion, Meraxes, and Vhagar—the Three-Headed Dragon is poised to unite all seven kingdoms of Westeros under one banner. This opportunity, will you capture it? Or let it slip?"
